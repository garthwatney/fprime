# DpTool

This directory contains the tool to read binary data products and write the output data in a JSON file.  
Example:
* `./data_product_writer.py makeU32Array.bin`  
will produce the output `./JSONoutput/makeU32Array.json`

The binary files in this directory are used as test cases.  They were all generated by running the unit test:
* `fprime-util check`

To run the tool on all the binary files in this directory:
* `./test.py`
